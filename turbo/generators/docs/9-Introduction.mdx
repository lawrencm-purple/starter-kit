# Introduction

Turbo Generators are powerful tools that help automate code generation tasks in your repository. They are built into Turborepo and provide a way to scaffold new code, create consistent file structures, and maintain development standards across your project.

## What are Turbo Generators?

Turbo Generators allow you to:

- Create custom templates for components, pages, or any code structures
- Maintain consistency across your codebase
- Speed up development by automating repetitive tasks
- Enforce best practices and coding standards

## Using Generators

You can run generators using the `turbo gen` command. For example:

```bash
turbo gen
```

This will show you a list of available generators in your repository. You can also run a specific generator directly:

```bash
turbo gen <generator-name>
```

## Creating Generators

You can create your own generators by adding a new script to your config file. See the templates/config.ts file for examples.
