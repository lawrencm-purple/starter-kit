# Storybook Type Definitions

## Overview

Storybook Type Definitions are a set of TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of Storybook stories. They provide a clear contract for the data that components expect and help ensure that stories are consistent and well-documented.

## Usage

a task has been setup to generate the types for the stories in /packages/storybook/package.json called generate. Ity can be triggerd by using

```bash

    turbo generateStoryblok
```

Alternativle you can use this cmd doit manually

```bash

    cd /packages/storyblok/src/types

storyblok pull-components --space 3000815

storyblok generate-typescript-typedefs --source ./components.3000815.json
```

## Purpose

Type definitions serve as a contract between the component and the story. They:

- **Ensure Consistency**: By defining a standard structure, they reduce discrepancies across different stories.
- **Improve Documentation**: Provide clear schema for what props a component expects, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Enable Type Safety**: Catch potential errors early by enforcing type checks during development.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: By having a common reference, team members can collaborate more efficiently without ambiguity.

## Benefits

Utilizing TypeScript with Storybook adds several benefits:

1. **Static Typing**: Detects errors during compile-time rather than runtime, reducing bug incidence.
2. **Enhanced Editor Support**: Code editors offer better auto-completion and error checking with defined types.
3. **Self-Documenting Code**: Types act as documentation for developers who read the code later.
