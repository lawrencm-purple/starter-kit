# UI Component Generator

This generator creates new presentational UI components for the project's component library.

## Purpose

Creates standardized, presentational ("dumb") components that:

- Accept props for data and callbacks
- Maintain internal state only when necessary
- Focus solely on UI rendering and local interactions
- Follow consistent file structure and naming conventions

## Usage

```bash
turbo gen UIComponent
```

## Prompts

You will be asked:

- **Component Name**: The name of your component (required)
  - Will be automatically formatted in appropriate cases (PascalCase, dash-case) where needed
  - Example: entering "DataTable" or "data-table" will generate consistent file naming

## Generated Files

For a component named "ExampleComponent", the following files will be created:

```

packages/ui/src/example-component
├── example-component.tsx # Main component file
└── example-component.stories.tsx # Storybook documentation
```

## File Structure

- **Component File** (`*.tsx`): Contains the main React component with TypeScript props interface
- **Stories File** (`*.stories.tsx`): Contains Storybook documentation and examples

## Best Practices

- Use this generator for presentational components only
- Keep business logic in container/parent components
- Limit internal state to UI-specific concerns (e.g., hover states, accordion open/close)
- Document props clearly in the TypeScript interface
- Include relevant Storybook examples for component variations

```
